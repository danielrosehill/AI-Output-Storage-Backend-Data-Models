# AI Output Storage Backend Data Models Documentation

## Project Purpose and Overview
This repository contains the backend data models used for storing outputs generated by various AI assistants. The purpose of this project is to provide a structured, scalable, and maintainable system for managing AI-generated content.

### Key Features:
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate an increasing number of AI assistants and data types.
- **Maintainability**: Models are organized in a logical manner to simplify future updates and enhancements.
- **Security**: Ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of stored data.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a modular structure:

```

## Context for AI Assistants
The models within this repository are specifically designed to work with outputs from different types of AI assistants, including but not limited to:
- Text generation models (e.g., GPT)
- Image generation models
- Audio processing models
Each model is tailored to store and manage the specific output formats generated by these AI assistants.
